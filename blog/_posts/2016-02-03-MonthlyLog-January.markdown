&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January I listed my goals for 2016. To ensure that I am working on my goals, I will post a log to share what I've been up to that month. January is now over I was hardly able to work on my goals. I have, however, been able to work on some of my goals. The goals I've worked on are:

1. Update my website/portfolio
	* Updated the content on my work page
	* Started sketches to plan the redisgn of the website
2. Start a new YouTube channel
	* Branding it (Avatar, intro title and outro title)
	* Have recorded 2 and edited 1 design video.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month I'm going to continue working on the redesign of my website. I also hope to be able to lunch my YouTube channel. When I am able to work on the branding for it I will start of updating you about it. I'm sorry I've been late with posting again, This was supposed to come out last week but I'm having problems with my computer and have to code everything by hand. I'm not sure I'll be able to accomplish what I would like this month as a result of that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a Great Day! Until next time,
