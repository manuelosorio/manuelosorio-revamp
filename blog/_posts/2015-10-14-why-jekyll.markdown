<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I start talking about today's topic I would just like to apologize for being late with this post. I had state exams this week and I have been struggling to catch up with the classes I missed. I was going to make a tutorial on how to use Jekyll. I decided to make an introduction instead.-->


### Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people like to use CMS (Content Management Systems) when creating a website or blog. WordPress is an example of a CMS. It manages your content through SQL Databases. Although making a website with WordPress is easy, it comes with one flaw, it has server-side dependencies. The use of the Databases can be an unpleasant experience for users because of long wait times. If the blog your making is not for a client or but for yourself you should try <a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> instead.

### What Is Jekyll?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jekyll is a ruby gem that is used to make static websites using  , liquid code, markdown, etc. The Jekyll site makes it be know as "a simple blog aware, static site generator.

### Why use Jekyll?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jekyll is doesn't have any databases so its secure for you and your users. If you use Jekyll you can host your site for free on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">github</a>. Also once you have your Jekyll site up and running it easy to edit it and more content to it. For example all I have to do add this blog post to my  site is create the file and fill the front matter below out and the post is added to my blog section all I do after is send it to my webhost and I'm done.

If you have time, get Jekyll and try it. There are many tutorials out there and if you just want to see the templating capabilities it has just go to <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyll themes</a> and try one. Also go to the Jekyll site to learn how to install Jekyll if you already have ruby installed(mac user most likely already do have it installed). If your a windows user and don't have it installed go to <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/">Julian Thilo's Jekyll for windows installation site</a>. That really helped me install ruby and Jekyll and every time I need to install Jekyll I refer to that site.

Have a great day,
