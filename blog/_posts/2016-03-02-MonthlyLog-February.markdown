&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignoring my lack of posts on February I was able to complete my goals for the month just in time for this log. It was a lot of work but I had fun doing so. Last Month I have done the following:

1. Website Revamp
	* Put a lot of what I want my website to be
	* I finish my sketches (now ready for Photoshop prototyping)

2. YouTube Channel
	* Branding it (Lower Thirds)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I probably won't post anything this month either. I am planning on focusing on the important design projects I need to complete. This month I am planning on:

1. Continuing on my Website Revamp
	* Start my Photoshop mockup and making sure that when it comes to coding I can nail the UI/UX
	* Redesign Logo
	* Make an icon Library for it
2. Officially launch my new YouTube Channel
	* Design Banner
	* Make a channel trailer
3. Do fun little projects (Challenging myself as designer)
	* For YouTube
	* For portfolio

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you have enjoyed! Until next time,
