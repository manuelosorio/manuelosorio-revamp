&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry for not updating my blog. I have promised a new post a every two weeks and I haven't posted anything new in the last 5 weeks. Besides not knowing what to write about, I have been busy with school work. The classes I have mostly been busy with are my Graphic Design class and my TV Production class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my design class I had to make a redesign the label for a root beer of a brand that isn't really mainstream. For that project I choose the brand called, "Dang! That's Good Rootbeer" and although I had a hard time finding information; I was able to have a fairly decent end result. I also was working on a poster for my school's charity run called, "Storm of Color, Run 5k".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video took much longer time because I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with it exactly. When my partner on the video and I discussed the ideas for the video in the span of 2-3 days. When we finally agreed on something we had a difficult time filming because we couldn't find enough people for the video. The day after we filmed we got in to a massive argument and I decided to work on it myself. I really like my end results for this video.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm so sorry for such a short blog post. I hoped you have enjoyed. This post was a substitute post for my the two posts I owe from the last 5 weeks. I hope to post next week.

Until next time. Have a great day,
