&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a year since I've last posted anything on here. My last post, <a href="https://manuelosorio.me/blog/posts/2016/august/who-am-i/" target="_blank" ><em>Who am I?</em></a>, was a state of self-discovery of who I am and hope to be. I strongly feel that what I wrote at that time, still applies to me now. I strongly feel that what I wrote at that time, still applies to me now. Being eager to learn new things and sharing my knowledge of it, is most important to me.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I struggle most with the blog is coming up with new topics for my posts. The main reason is that I've approached it in the wrong way all this time. When I started this blog, I was advised to use this blog as a medium of finding my voice and the way I think. I was also told that I should use this as a place to document what I'm learning. I want to find my voice by documenting what I learn. I hope that by doing so, I can provide value to whoever stumbles upon my blog.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of August 2016, I started my year in college. I learned so much this past year. In the last two months, I took my first courses in the graphics program. I found it somewhat stressful at times because I had assignments do every class. Although, looking back now, It was a great experience for me since I had to work quickly and had to become adaptable. I had to work with tight deadlines and needed to present the thought process behind my work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my website redesign, I hope to complete it in the next two weeks, however, my deadline for the launch is  August 31.

Have a great day, <br />
