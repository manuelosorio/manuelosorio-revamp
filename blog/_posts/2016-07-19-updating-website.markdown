### ~~Quick~~ Update on What I'm Up to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put my work CSS framework on pause for a while because I need some time a while from it so I can revaluate it. Right now I am finally updating my website (currently working on the homepage). Everyday I am working on new things for the homepage and after fixing my bugs uploading it to my webhost. The home page is almost complete need to add three more things and than fix whatever problems that arise from adding them. I'm forcing myself to update the site at least once per day so I would actually finish the revamp because not seeing the style match across the site will really bother me (it already is bothering me).<br />

### Wireframe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first planned on doing this I didn't no where to start. I ended up writing a lot and drawing a user site map to plan out where in my site I want a potential client (for freelance work) or employer (looking for a design job) to go. I am not sure why I've been into slants for a while now I just like the way they look. Perhaps I've been watching too many SuperCarlinBrothers videos (I can't stop staring at the blue and red portrait in the background of J's videos). Anyway, when I was sketching I was keeping in mind that I wanted slants in it.<br /><br />

### Mockup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After deciding the which sketches I liked most I started the mockup. I skipped a few wireframing steps because I wanted to get right into the design. Doing that was not a good idea because that meant I was skipping over an important part of the discovery process. As I was designing adding slants to things here and there I was becoming unhappy with the design time and time again I would move things around in Photoshop. No matter how I laid them out the design just wouldn't work. I realized that the reason for that was that I was over doing it with the slants. I was adding them but not in a why that it would be complementary with the design. Once I realized that I started over making new design decisions. The design decisions I've made have been thinking of two things: 1) It has to look good 2) Keep user interested in scrolling and viewing more information.<br /><br />

### Current state as of writing this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All week I've been coding this all week and I got to admit making the slants is simpler than I thought it would be but much more challenging. For some reason every time I add slants to a new object of my page the layout would just break and I would need to change things in the breakpoint of my media queries. I've got admit this past week chrome dev tools has really become my new best friend (AD & CD if for whatever reason your are actually reading this don't worry you two aren't replaced ;-) ).<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry for making you scroll too much, possible grammar/spelling errors (I have spellcheck but I am up late writing this and I'm half asleep ), and for last week's terrible post. I'll try to get a post tomorrow since I'm early with this one (Just found out its not Wednesday after thinking I was late again).

Have a great day, <br />
