&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 31st, 2015, I announced that I was going to start my own blog. I made a promise that every two weeks on Wednesday I will post new content on my blog. On September 31, 2015 I launched the blog and had my first official post titled, "Fear of Success is Often Mistaken as Fear of Failing". In that post I was actually talking about myself and it was more about realizing my problem and breaking away from it. That "fear of success" is still affecting me but not as much as before. I have, however, failed to my commitment to post new content on my blog every two weeks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be consistent on making new post while keeping relevance. In the past few weeks I have come to realize that I can't have one with the other without making sacrifices. I can longer keep making these post the day before or day of my deadline. If I want to stay consistent I need to create a buffer of work. Doing so will not only allow me to stay consistent but it will also allow me to update my blog weekly. I want my content to stay relevant and in order to do that I need redefine what relevance means to me. To me relevance is being a make content based on what I have been working on or sharing what's on my mind the week of my post deadline. When someone read my blog (unless that person knows me personally and is in constant communication with me) won't know the difference between posting about something I did a week ago or a day ago. That being said, I think my definition of relevance would be better being something that the time I post new content my thoughts on a matter are still the same or the work I share was made within the month the content is posted.
