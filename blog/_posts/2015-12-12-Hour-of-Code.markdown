&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a society today, where code is a big part of our lives. The device your using to read this blog is made with code; as a matter of fact this website is made up of code. It surprises me that coding is so foreign to many people. A few days ago my online school hosted "The Hour of Code". <a target="_blank" href="https://hourofcode.com/">The Hour of Code</a> is an initiative that introduces computer science to millions of students around the world. Although I already know how to code I decided to participate in it just for fun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have always been interested in learning to code but never have known where to start, you should consider try the hour of code. The hour of code is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning to code. Through <a target="_blank" href="https://code.org/">code.org</a>, you can learn some of the basics of code via click and drag functions or if you want you can also use simple JavaScript.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using <a href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> is also a fun way to learn the basics of computer science. You can learn some basic JavaScript with Star Wars. When I participated in the hour of code I did the Star Wars one and although, I found it easy it was really fun. Coding shouldn't be boring, developers find coding fun, which is why it's a good thing that <a target="_blank" href="https://code.org/">code.org</a> keeps the activities in their site fun.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just find it amazing that it doesn't matter the age, whether or not you have internet; you can participate in the hour of code. Until next time,
