<p><strong>Storm of color run was the first ever color in Celebration High School.</strong> All proceeds went to <a href="http://www.noahslightfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><em>Noah's Light Foundation</em></a>. For the color run I needed to make a poster and a video to inform the school about Storm of Color and get more people want to join.</p>
