<p><strong>This a timer that counts down to the new year, its pretty self explanatory.</strong> You can see the live version <a href="/NewYear-CountDown" target="_blank">here.</a> If you like to keep track how much time is left of the year I recomend you bookmark. When I decided to make this I wanted to make something people can look back at and use throughout the year, espiaclly New Year's Eve.</p>
